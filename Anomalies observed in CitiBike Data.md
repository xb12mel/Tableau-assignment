## Anomalies observed in CitiBike Data ##

### Birth Year: Suspect User supplied information ###
I noticed a very large number of advanced aged customers
based on their registered birth year. While it is possible
that one or two customers in New York are over 100 years 
old and still riding bicycles, it is highly unlikely that
239 customers aged 100+ years in 2013 would be riding
bicycles. 

### Extended Rental Periods ###
According to the CitiBike website, regardless of your
membership status or bike type, if your rental is greater
than 45 minutes, the rental fee is $0.12/minute. This chart
marks all of the trip durations greater than 3 SD which
happens to be just about 3 days. There are more than 130 of
these "Extended Rental Periods" which exceed the replacement
cost of the bike.

### Most egregious trip durations and distance ###
While it is possible that someone could actually ride a peddle bike
9 miles in under 45 minutes, it would be rather unusual to do so, while 
fighting in city traffic and crossing bridges and using ferries. There are
more than a hand full of examples where riders average 8 miles in a single
rental period in about 45 minutes. Others on this page show the longest 
rental period, where the starting station was and where the ending station is 
based on bike ID.
